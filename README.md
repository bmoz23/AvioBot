# AvioBot- Pilot Voice Assistant

## Project Description
**Aviobot** is an LLM-powered voice assistant bot developed to help pilots manage various tasks more efficiently during flights. The project enables pilots to query flight data in real-time through voice commands, providing quick access to critical information. It is an advanced copilot.

Aviobot leverages LangChain technology for natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, allowing it to understand and respond to pilot queries instantly. The project is specifically designed to enhance flight safety while reducing the workload on pilots. It uses OpenAI API Key to communicate with OpenAI GP4-4-turbo-Preview model. 

Aviobot uses OpenAI's TTS-1 Nova voice model as the speech synthesis engine, enabling natural and clear voice interactions. Leveraging LangChain technology for natural language processing (NLP), Aviobot understands and responds to pilot queries instantly, enhancing flight safety while reducing the workload on pilots. In addition, Aviobot employs Pinecone as the vector database, which facilitates efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring that queries are processed quickly and accurately. This combination of technologies is specifically designed to enhance flight safety while reducing the workload on pilots.

## Installation 

To get Aviobot up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:
